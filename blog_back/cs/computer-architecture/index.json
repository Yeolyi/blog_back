It covers the topics including multilevel implementation strategies, definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, processes) and their mechanization using lower-level elements. It also includes analysis of potential concurrency, precedence constraints and performance measures, pipelined and multidimensional systems, instruction set design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.\n\n### 출처\n\n[computationstructures.org](https://computationstructures.org/index.html)\n\n[mit opencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/)\n\n### 기록\n\n[pdf 필기 백업(github)](https://github.com/Yeolyi/Computation_Structures)\n","path":"cs/computer-architecture/index.md"}
