To do so, place a + (an **adjacent sibling combinator**) between the selectors.\n\n### Styling things based on state\n\n```css\na:link {\n  color: pink;\n}\n\na:visited {\n  color: green;\n}\n\n/* This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a <p>, which comes just after an <h1>, which is inside a <body>. Phew! */\nbody h1 + p .special {\n  color: yellow;\n  background-color: black;\n  padding: 5px;\n}\n```\n","path":"frontend/css/getting-started/index.md"}
