{"pathArr":[],"metaData":{"title":"The box model"},"content":"\nChanging the value of the display property can change whether the outer display type of a box is block or inline. This changes the way it displays alongside other elements in the layout.\n\nMaking up a block box in CSS we have the:\n\n- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.\n- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.\n- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.\n- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.\n\nNote: The margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.\n\n### Margins, padding, and borders\n\nDepending on whether two elements whose margins touch have positive or negative margins, the results will be different:\n\n- Two positive margins will combine to become one margin. Its size will be equal to the largest individual margin.\n- Two negative margins will collapse and the smallest (furthest from zero) value will be used.\n- If one margin is negative, its value will be subtracted from the total.\n\nUnlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding.\n\nIn inline boxes, width and height are ignored. The vertical margin, padding, and border are respected but don't change the relationship of other content to our inline box.\n\n```html\n<style>\n  /* 수평 margin은 적용되긴 한다 */\n  /* padding을 넣어도 주변 요소들이 밀리지 않는다 */\n  span {\n    margin: 10px;\n    padding: 10px;\n    width: 80px;\n    height: 5px;\n    background-color: lightblue;\n    border: 2px solid blue;\n  }\n</style>\n<body>\n  <p>\n    I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span is an inline\n    element and so does not respect width and height.\n  </p>\n</body>\n```\n\ndisplay: inline-block is a special value of display, which provides a middle ground between inline and block. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect width and height and avoid the overlapping seen above.\n","path":"frontend/css/box-model/index.md"}
