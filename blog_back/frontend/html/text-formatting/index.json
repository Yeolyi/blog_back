It would be correct to use it in the footer of a site to include the contact information of the entire site, or inside an article for the contact details of the author, but not to mark up a list of addresses unrelated to the content of that page.\n\nYou will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript.\n\nThere are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML. code, pre, var, kbd, samp...\n\nHTML also provides the <time> element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format. For example:\n\n```html\n<time datetime=\"2016-01-20\">20 January 2016</time>\n```\n","path":"frontend/html/text-formatting/index.md"}
